## Branche

To isolate changes, use the [branching](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches).

* Create a new branch

* Switch to another branch

* Merge branches

---

When switching branches, 'git' can change files.
