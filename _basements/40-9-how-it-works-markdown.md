  * Clone the repository
    * Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
    * Create a new branch: Always create a new branch before starting any work.
    * Make changes: Now you can make any changes you need to make to the 'local branch' files on your laptop.
    * Stage changes: Once you have made your changes, you need to stage them. Make sure to stage all the files which are related to specific functionality, see `breaking commits`. __---- NEEDS LINK TO RELEVANT ITEM ----__
    * Commit changes: Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them in your local git clone. Remember to add a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made.
    * Merge changes: If you are working in a team, someone else may have made changes to the same branch. In that case, you will need to merge their changes with yours before pushing.
    * Push changes: Finally, you need to push your changes to the remote repository. This makes your changes available to others, publicly or privately.
    * Pull changes: Before you start working again, you should always pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
