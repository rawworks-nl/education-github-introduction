## Markdown

The README.md or README.markdown files are based on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) formatting.

| Markdown | HTML |
| --- | --- | 
| \_\_bold text\_\_ | \<b\>bold text\</b\> |
| \[link\](url) | \<a href=url\>link\</a\> |

HTML = complex, advanced formatting

Markdown = simple, limited formatting
